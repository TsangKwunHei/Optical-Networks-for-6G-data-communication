    Read (1st line)
    num slices
    PortBW_Gbps

    for each slice in slices, 
        Read  (2nd line)
            num slice packets  
            UBD_i
            SliceBW_i
        Get m_i, SliceBW_i, UBD_i
            For each packet in slice,
                Read  (2n+1 line)
                    ts 
                    pkt_size
                Assign

                    deadline
                append to dict packets & all_packets
        Store ( for each slice )
            UBD_i

            dict packets (sorted by ts)

            -> append all to slice_info

     
     sort all_packets by ts
     total num of input packets 
     Define
        current_time 
        port_available_time (count_run_time)
        packet_idx (current processing packet)
        scheduled_packets dict 
        heap dict (keep track of the smallest element.)

    

    if packet_idx < total_packet or heap
    ( Before all packets are finish processed )

        add all packet into heap
        get packet with highest priority
        move current time to next

    Determine earliest possible departure time
