How to Lower max((te_ij - ts_ij))
AKA
LOWER leavetime - arrival time of each packet
which is lower max leave time


C1 Leave time next packet - Leave time previous packet must >>
than packet size of the previous packet divided by port bandwidth.

if 
    leave time next packet --
    leave time previous packet --

limitation factor is leave time previous packet

C2 Sum PacketSize in same slice / total duration of slice (leavetime last packet - arrival time of 1st packet)
must be bigger than 95% of it's SliceBandwith 

if leave time lower, C2 higher, so no pm

3 packets in same slice leave in same order as they arrive
