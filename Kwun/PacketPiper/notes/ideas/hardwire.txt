Constraint 1. 
        Scheduling output sequence must meet the port bandwidth constraint (PortBW). 
        the following requirements must be met.
            {te_{k,m} - te_{i,j}} => PktSize_{i,j}/PortBW  

        te_{i,j}        leave time of previous packet
        te_{k,m}        leave time of next packet 
        PktSize_{i,j}   size of the processing Packet 


Constraint 2.
        Output bandwidth constraint for the ith slice (SliceBW_i)

        PacketSize_i/ te_{i,m} - ts_{i,1} => SliceBW_i * 0.95
        
        PacketSize_i    sum of all packetsize in a slice
        te_{i,m}        departure time of last packet in the ith slice
        ts_{i,1}        arrival time of first packet in the ith slice 

Constraint 3 
        Packets in the same slice must leave in the order in which they arrived, 
        and the packet leaving time must be longer than the packet arrival time.
        
        te_{i,j+1} => te_{i,j}
        te_{i,j} => ts_{i,j}

</Delay>

<Rules>
    Embed these rules in the code (make it so that code doesnt run)
    Must have rules for the code 
        Num Output set of packet has to equal to input set (num slice users) **
        Runtime has to be < 2 min * 
        The Output Slice ID and Packet ID must start from 0.
        The timestamp of packets (te_{i,j} & ts_{i,j} etc )must be an integer, which unit is ns.
